This is the special repository with scripts and patches for Steam deb-package:
  http://repo.steampowered.com/steam/pool/steam/s/steam/
  http://store.steampowered.com/about/

Here is the list of advantages of repackaged deb-package:
* Dangerous script is deleted from package: /usr/bin/steamdeps
* Extra files are deleted from package: /etc/apt/*
* Package dependencies are updated, so package can be easily installed into
  Debian >= 7.0 (Wheezy) without any extra actions.
* Necessary libraries from Ubuntu libc6 package are added into repackaged steam
  package and launching script is patched. So you do not have to update your
  system libc6 package to make Steam work. Just launch steam after package
  installation.

If Steam does not start on the first try, read its console output carefully.
For example, you may catch such error in Debian:
  [0318/235903:ERROR:shared_memory_posix.cc(167)] Creating shared memory in
  /dev/shm/org.chromium.Chromium.shmem.libcef_16076686305058492654 failed:
  Permission denied
  [0318/235903:ERROR:shared_memory_posix.cc(170)] Unable to access(W_OK|X_OK)
  /dev/shm: Permission denied
  [0318/235903:FATAL:shared_memory_posix.cc(172)] This is frequently caused by
  incorrect permissions on /dev/shm.  Try 'sudo chmod 1777 /dev/shm' to fix.

As you see solution is simple:
$ sudo chmod 1777 /dev/shm
